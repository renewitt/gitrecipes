ingredients:
  Cupcakes:
    - 1 1/8 cups all purpose flour
    - 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
    - 1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
    - 1/2 teaspoon salt
    - 3/4 cup granulated sugar
    - 1 large egg
    - 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
    - 3/4 cup Kahlua
    - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
    - 4 ounces of high-quality dark chocolate, coarsely chopped
    - 1/2 cup white chocolate chips
  Frosting:
    - 1 cup (2 sticks) sweet cream butter, softened to room temperature
    - 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar
    - 1 tablespoon Kahlua
    - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
method:
  Cupcakes:
    - Preheat oven to 180 degrees C.
    - In a bowl, whisk egg and sugar until smooth and no lumps remain. Add melted butter and vanilla and mix until combined.
    - Sift dry ingredients together and add to wet mixture. Mix until batter is smooth with a large spoon, then whisk in kahlua. Fold in chocolate.
    - Line a muffin tin with liners and using a heaping 1/4 cup measure, add batter to each cup until 3/4 of the way full.
    - Bake for 15-18 minutes. Let cool completely before frosting.
  Frosting:
    - Beat butter in the bowl of your electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.
    - Add in powdered sugar gradually (about 1/2 cup at a time) with the mixer on low speed, slowly increasing the speed until itâ€™s combined. Add in vanilla extract and kahlua, then beat on medium-high speed for 3-4 minutes, occasionally scraping down the sides if needed, until white and fluffy.
    - Frost cupcakes and garnish with grated white and dark chocolate.
notes:
  - These are prone to sticking and sinking. They cook best in a harder and thicker cardboard cupcake cup, than a traditional thin wrapper. Avoid opening the oven during cooking at all costs.
