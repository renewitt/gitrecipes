description: This drink is an old classic enjoyed by many, kids and adults. This will be
  sure to please especially on a hot day. Similar to water, but much more refreshing, this
  drink can go with just about anything.
ingredients:
- 2 cups fresh clear water
- 3-5 ice cubes
- lime (optional)
method:
- Delicately place ice cubes in a tall glass, as not to break them.
- Shake glass from side to side as to allow the ice to settle in the bottom of the glass.
- Evenly fill the glass with the water. You will notice a cracking noise (this is normal).
- Wait about one minute for ice to chill the water.
- In the meantime rinse the lime and cut into wedges.
- Make an incision on the inside of one wedge and place over the side of the glass. Or
  just place a few lime wedges directly inside the glass if you prefer.
notes:
- lime can be substituted with lemon if desired
- if you experience pain due to sensitive teeth, you can use a straw
